This is a react boiler plate to setup your own custom react projects rather than using create-react-app. Use npm install to install all the dependencies in this package and npm run start to run the development server,npm run build to build to react project and npm run format to run prettier and format your code. The start, build, and format commands can be changed in the package.json and other shortcuts may be added as well. You may customize this template in however ways you like.
